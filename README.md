# custom_defs
A collection of custom modules I've written over the years.

The most comprehensive of these is custom2.py. Eventually,
I hope to package them in a more formal way and weed out some
of the more useless functions (as well as some that are broken),
but for now this serves mostly as a place to do version control.

Please feel free to use these as you see fit - I hope others
find some of these functions useful.
